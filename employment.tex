	\textbf{Edison Engineering Development Program} (2 year technical leadership rotational program)
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Developed a steady state aeroelastic code in Python for wind turbine blades by coupling in-house aerodynamics (BEM) and structural (FEM, corotational beam elements) codes.
     \item Developed a FEM mesh manipulation library in C++, based on the Partial Entity data structure for representation of non-manifold edges.
     \item Contributed to the development of an aeroelastic mode tracking module in Python, based on a Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC).
     \item Implemented a critical Python module for improving 50-year extreme load extrapolation on the AWS simulation environment by making the tail of the load distribution denser.
\end{itemize}
